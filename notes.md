**Object-Oriented Design**


**Designing Classes with a Single Responsiblity**

Easy to Change
- changes have no unexpected side effects
- small changes in requirements require correspondingly small changes in code
- existing code is easy to reuse
- the easiest way to make a change is to add code that in itself is easy to change

Code Should Have These qualities: 
- Transparent
- Reasonable
- Usable
- Exemplary

TRUE - code that not only meets today's needs but can also be changed to meet the needs of the future

THe path to changeable and maintable object-oriented software begins with classes that have a single responsibility. Classes that do one thing isolate that thing from the rest of your applicaiton. This isolation allows changes without consequence and reuse without duplication.
